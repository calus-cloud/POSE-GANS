# PoseGAN â€“ Pose-Based Human Image Generation

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement Deformable GANs for generating person images conditioned on a given pose.
Specifically, given an image of a person and a target pose, the goal is to synthesize a new image of that same person in the specified pose.

## Approach
